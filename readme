I created a file on my desktop that i  placed index. html ,style.css,lisence and read me .
i confirmed if they were working through my terminal then opened them with my visual studio code which enabled me to add what i wanted save then  i went back to the terminal git added git commited and git pushed  them more than 20 times.
i went back to github merged my master to my github pages  then afterwards deployed the link.
