    <h2>Reasons for choosing programming</h2>
    <p>I developed an interest in programming right after I studied C++ and I wanted to find out more about programming languages. The desire led me to moringa school which is a very interesting school that teaches students how to learn and solve their problems on their own and through pairs</p>
